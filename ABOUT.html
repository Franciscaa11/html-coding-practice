        As a frontend developer,i find it really amazing at how much i've learnt
        these past few weeks,<br />from starting off as a beginner to learning a
        whole new language such as HTML which involves tags,then CSS styling and
        all.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've adapted the problem solving skill,to search for issues with my
        codes until i figure it out and i'm like finally!!! <br />
        Sometimes,it could be as little as omitting a closing tag,and when it
        gets all confusing,i reach out to my colleagues.
        <br />

        So yeah,this is me.
